*Conclusion

**Summary

The dataset, new_full_student_data.csv, contains information about students in various schools. To conduct a data analysis, the data was first imported into a Pandas DataFrame using the read_csv function. The head function was then used to confirm that the data was properly imported. The data was cleaned by removing missing or NaN values, removing duplicates, and converting the columns as necessary. A comparison between district and charter schools was then made using the groupby function. 

The analysis showed that charter schools had a higher mean math score but only slightly higher mean reading score compared to district schools. Charter schools also had a smaller school size and, presumably and commensurately, class size on average and spent more money per student compared to district schools.
